    o	bash scripts -- changed TACC and HPC scripts to manually load modules and to call all commands from bash scripts, as some commands don't see to work from within a script (such as qsub from an ssh command).
    o	bash scripts -- Make future runs put all logs from job starts into the logs directory instead of the ManageMBatch-TACC directory.
    o	MBatchSetup.buildPendingScripts - only do Assessment and EBwithPriors when "all" algorithms is selected
    o	R script (runSimpleMBatch_BEA.R) change to only do corrections for TSS and BatchId


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT
    o	Changes for related Java applications - Converted to IO Commons 2.2 JAR.
    o	Remove use of doMC and related multicore, foreach packages, replaces with snowfall from new features above.
